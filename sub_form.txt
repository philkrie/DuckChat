Server crashes have been mostly resolved. By the nature of this program, it is very difficult to test every single possible case, so while I have tried to do the best job that I can, there could still be some server crashes. I haven’t experienced any in a while, but I should really study for finals over hours of testing. Furthermore, there was not even an attempt at the soft state portion. I simply did not have the time. Thanks a lot for your hard work this term.
